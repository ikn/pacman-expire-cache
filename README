pacman-expire-cache 0.2-next.

http://ikn.org.uk/pacman-expire-cache

A tool for deleting old cached package files for the `pacman` package manager.
Existing cache cleaners generally offer the ability to retain the latest X
versions of each package, or of each installed package.  This is not useful in
the following cases:
 - a package has been broken for a while, but not used recently, and has been
   updated many times recently, such that you only notice the issue once all
   working versions have been deleted
 - a package has been accidentally removed, and then an update pushed which
   breaks it

`pacman-expire-cache` solves these issues by allowing you to retain:
 - package files newer than X days
 - the latest Y versions (older than X days) for each installed package
 - the latest Z versions (older than X days) for each not-installed package
